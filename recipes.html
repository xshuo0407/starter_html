        <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined.</li>

        <p>This is only meal I can cook, but I cook it well.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef steak</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Use kitchen paper to wipe away the blood from the surface of the beef, and evenly apply sea salt and black pepper on the beef surface for marination. </li>
            <li>Pour olive oil into a pan and heat it on high heat. After the oil is hot, add the steak and sear each side for 1 minute to 1 minute and 15 seconds to achieve the Maillard reaction.</li>
            <li>Add butter to the pan and reduce the heat to low. Use a spoon to drizzle the melted butter over the surface of the steak. Add garlic, rosemary, and other vegetables.</li>
            <li>Sear each side of the steak for an additional 40 seconds and then remove from the pan. Add hot water to the pan and bring it to a boil to reduce the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the surface of the steak.</li>
